# 2022_IBM_Code_Challenge_OfficeSeek

**PROBLEM STATEMENT**

People rely on government offices, especially panchayats and ward offices, to fulfill a lot of their official requirements. The only way for users to request various government services is to fill out forms in the government office. In addition, they have to visit the office periodically to review the status of the application, which is both time consuming and tedious. This system also entertains the officers to not do the work in time and to keep delaying the process because they are not held accountable.

**SOLUTION**

An application that digitizes the process of sending applications/requests to government offices.
There will be two types of users: general users and official users.

<ins>General User</ins>

1) A user registers using his or her details and pincode.
2) The application that they have submitted will appear in the dashboard of officials who serve in offices under the users registered pincode.
3) The user can find existing applications they have filed and its status in their dashboard.

<ins>Official User</ins>
1) Officials can view applications that have been posted for them to work on (under their office) in their dashboard.
2) They can resolve, reject or escalate. This will be reflected in the database and inturn will be reflected in the concerned users dashboard.

**PROBLEMS SOLVED BY THE APPLICATION**

1) The time common people spend at the offices filing the application and time spent on revisits to check the status of application can be saved.
2) The officials will be held accountable to complete the work in time.
3) Crowds at government offices can be controlled by digitizing a lot of the processes.
